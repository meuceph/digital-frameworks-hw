# Nanette Barragan
## Political Career
Nanette Barragan is a 40 year old, Latina congresswoman representing California's 44th Congressional District. The district includes Carson,
Compton, Lynwood, North Long Beach, Rancho Dominguez, San Pedro, South Gate, Walnut Park, Watts/Willowbrook, and Wilmington, 
according to Barragan's house page. 

As a congresswoman, Barragan wants to focus on educational opportunities for her district and on the federal level. "The district
is one where only 60 percent graduate from high school and 10 percent go onto college," she told the Daily Breeze in 2015.
"I'm one of the 10-percenters who beat the odds... I've achieved the American dream. Now I'm coming home to make sure that others
have the same shot at the dream."

Before becoming a Representative, Barragan served as the first Latina on the Hermosa Beach City Council. She was also the first
woman to serve on the Council in 10 years. Barragan had also worked as a volunteer "attorney director" for President Barack 
Obama's campaign in Florida. She served in this role in 2012, making sure that everyone eligible to vote was legally able to
vote. Barragan had also worked for the Clinton administration and served on the Board of the Los Angeles County Young Democrats.

## Education and Life
A graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Southern California School of Law, Barragan
worked at Latham & Watkins, LLP. 

Barragan was born in Harbor City, California and grew up in Carson, California. She did not, however, live in her district
at the time of her election. Her parents are immigrants from Mexico.
